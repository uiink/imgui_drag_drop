This is the Quill project created as a companion to uiink's article on creating an [immediate mode drag and drop UI](https://uiink.com/articles/data-driven-immediate-mode-ui/).

Quill is a visual tool for creating user interfaces without code. In the article we explore the idea of taking a data oriented approach to immediate mode UI. Presentation and how the GUI manipulates that data is defined entirely within Quill.
